                    <p><strong>Feeling:</strong> This is the first time I tried to walk up to foreign people and talk to them.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>9.18:</strong> It's the first time I came up to foreigners and talked. At first, I felt nervous, but my classmates and Brady encouraged me through this, and it eventually amazed me.</li>
                <li><strong>9.19:</strong> Work and study all day??? :( Exhausted!!!</li>
                <li><strong>9.20:</strong> I woke at 11 am and spent the whole day in the dormitory. I watched a lot of videos, like a man teaching us how to speak English properly in real life. Interesting.</li>
                <li><strong>9.21:</strong> I went out with my friend, and we talked a lot, like about lesbians and Elizabeth.</li>
                <li><strong>9.22:</strong> I watched a video of Zhou Yuelong beaten by Mark Alen in the British Open. He caught up to 8 to 7 from 2 to 6 and reached the match point first, but lost. So pity.</li>
                <li><strong>9.23:</strong> I had oral class today and I presented my experience of talking to foreign students. It's great but I still feel nervous talking in front of a buntch of classmates, especially in English. Still a long way to go~ I met Nino in the supermarket, she's a nice girl.</li>
