                <li><strong>9.20:</strong> I woke at 11 am and spent the whole day in the dormitory. I watched a lot of videos, like a man teaching us how to speak English properly in real life. Interesting.</li>

                <li><strong>9.23:</strong> I had oral class today and I presented my experience of talking to foreign students.

I send some pictures to my friend, who then asked me for some , and I brought some for him. I played basketball with my father. He told me he had been a great basketball player in high school and he hadn't played it since I went to middle school. A bit sad. The basketball I bought for him at his birthday was still brand new. In the evening, I went out playing badminton with my friend, and I brought him some fruit.</li>
                <li><strong>10.6:</strong> The Mid Autumn Festival. We went back to hometown again, we had a great lunch. At afternoon, I went out playing basketball with two friends of mine, and I was happy to find that I was getting better at Running jump shot.</li>
